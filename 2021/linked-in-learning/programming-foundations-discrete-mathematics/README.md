### Basics of discrete mathematics

* Study of math that falls outside calculus
  - Calculus is study of continuous math concepts
  - Discrete is study of, well, discrete concepts
    - Separable, countable, qualified objects
* e.g. Analog vs. digital
* Core concepts
  - Logic: identify predicates, formatting conditional statements,
    adding quantifiers, logical operations
  - Set theory: enumerate groups of data: infinite and finite sets
  - Number theory: using integers/natural numbers to enumerate sets of
    data
  - Graph theory: model pair-wise relationships b/w objects
  - Combinatorics: study of finite countable discrete structures
    - used in number theory, graph theory, probability theory
    - e.g. study of sequences such as fibonacci
    - involves mathematical reasoning combined with creativity and
      problem solving
