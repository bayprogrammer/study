Calculate amortization schedules.

This is mainly a learning project for me to figure out how amortization
schedule calculations work (and brush up on Perl) by creating a practical
little calculator utility.  The goal is to be able to run the calculator with
different variables for interest and payment amounts to see how it affects the
payment schedules.

This is a *WORK IN PROGRESS*, and I know that calculations are not yet correct.
Do not use in current state except to to experiment with it.
