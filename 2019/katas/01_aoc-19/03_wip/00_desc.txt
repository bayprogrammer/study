--- Day 3: Crossed Wires ---

Source: https://adventofcode.com/2019/day/3

We need to trace each wire fully to detect the cross-points (origin point,
which is shared by both wires, does not count as an intersection for this
purpose).

Each point's distacnce is like a chess rook's distance between two points
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry).

We need to find the nearest point among the set of points where the two wires
cross eachother (a wire crossing over itself does not count, and the
intersection at their common point of origin does not count).

Data input file: each line in file is a wire; each wire is defined by direction
and steps: Rn (move n spaces right), Ln (move n spaces left), Un (move n spaces
up), Dn (move n spaces down).

Each wire starts at the same point of origin, and move relative to that point.
