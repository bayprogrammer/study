--- Day 1: The Tyranny of the Rocket Equation ---

--- Part One ---

Write calculator that takes all inputs representing the mass of all the modules
which the rocket consists of; calculate the amount of fuel needed for all of
the modules based on the following formula: for each module:
floor((module_weight / 3) - 2); take the sum of the fuel requirement of each
module.

    12 -> 2
    14 -> 2
  1969 -> 654
100756 -> 33583

--- Part Two ---

Calculate the fuel needed for the modules including the fuel needed for the
mass of the fuel itself (treat negative calculations as requiring 0 fuel).
Calculate repeatedly using the previous fuel's mass as input into the
calculator until reaching this zero state, and include these totals in the
final sum.
