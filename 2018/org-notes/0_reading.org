I bought the paper version, but I'll probably read the online version
(because it's a bit easier given my workspace to read digital editions
than physical ones, especially when I want to type a lot on my
computer (for notes and code).

The page has the full text, as well as links to where the paper copy
can be purchased. Apress has an eBook (DRM free, watermarked PDF) as
well, which would probably be my preferred format to acquire the book.

- Learn C++ Tutorial

  [2018-07-13 Fri]

  http://www.learncpp.com/

  Very good looking content, but way too many ads. I can kill them
  with an ad blocker, but ads how are the dude keeps the site running.
  I could donate something via PayPal, but I'm out of book cash for
  now, so I'm just shelving this. The ads aren't just annoying,
  they're intrusive, deceptive ("Download PDF" links right below the
  text, deceptively injected so people click it thinking they get a
  PDF of the text rather than going to some external ad site), and
  unethical (trackers abound). I'd rather not use the resource (at
  least until I can donate something) than be subjected to abusive
  advertisements.
