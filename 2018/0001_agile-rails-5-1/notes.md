I wonder if, by default, Rails 5.x stores session information inside the cookie directly (crypted), or just stores a session id of some sort in the cookie (still crypted) and then uses a server-side session store to look up the session based on that cookie. The latter is how my previous work with Django worked, and I quite liked that.
